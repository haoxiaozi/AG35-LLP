Package: dbus-dbg
Version: 1.8.20-r0
Description: D-Bus message bus - Debugging files
 D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to
 one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps
 coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a
 \"single instance\" application or daemon, and to launch applications and
 daemons on demand when their services are needed.  This package contains
 ELF symbols and related sources for debugging purposes.
